# Clojure

## Usage

Clojure is best used through the REPL, but there are some CLI entry points.

Dependencies will be installed when you start the application or repl. You can
download Clojure [here](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure).

To run the application

``` sh
clj -M:run
```

To run the tests

``` sh
clj -M:test
```
