TODO
====

The tests are bit funny at the moment because nodeunit assertions only
fail at the end of the test. Fortunately the built in assertions format nicely
and won't prevent additional tests from running so I use them mostly.
Except one at the end to keep the grunt nodeunit plugin happy.
This could be improved by migrating to a different test framework.
Mocha looks good.
